* This is a Netlist File. I personally found this easier to work on this than the schematic viewer which may not be the case for the reader.
* Simulate this file to get a schematic view of the circuit.
* Okay, I just found out that a lot of 2nd yearites/ 3rd yearites have this link. Don't get me in trouble. Plis. Thank you
* This probably wont even work. Just saying......
* Lol. 
* I'll try commenting whatever will help for your MuE asst.
* Also, This netlist is for a 3 stage differential amplifier. So thats Differential stage, Gain Stage and a buffer.
* Draw out the nodes on a paper for better understanding.
* IDK who found this but designing from scratch will save you time.
* vlsifacts.com/5-steps-design-differential-amplifier/ is a good place to start.
* Now that I've discouraged you enough. ATB for your assignment. Its not that hard. Keep at it lol.
* Might as well throw in some APOGEE publicity now that you're still reading this.
* ADC and CDC are good events. Attend them next year lol. Sorry that this edition had to glitch out. :)

* Be sure to include the above file. Otherwise LTSpice will simulate using default transistors. Not really useful for the assignment
Vdd 1 0 2.5   * Change the 2.5 to whatver your Vdd value is.        
*Vdd 1 0 AC SINE(2.5 1m 100k) * Ignore This. Not relevant to your asst.
* current reference decided after applying sweep.
Iref 2 0 86u      * Change the 86u to whatever the current value is in your asst.
*Vin1 in 0 0
Vin1 in 0 AC SINE(1 0.1m 1000k) * Input voltage for M3. Will  be useful in gain calc
*Vin2 5 0 AC SINE(1 0.1m 1000k) * Give this input for the "differential part of the amplifier". If youre essentially just tinkering around, Give this voltage for your V2 in (V1-V2)
Vin2 5 0 1
* W/L values of different transistors, decided after sweeping for maximum gain.
